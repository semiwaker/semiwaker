  + Works within the research group are forked and published at: [https://github.com/pku-liang](https://github.com/pku-liang). Contributors may be inaccurate.
    + [TENET](https://github.com/pku-liang/TENET): An analytical framework that models hardware dataflow of tensor applications on spatial architectures. Did some minor work on programming and mathematics.
    + [TensorLib](https://github.com/pku-liang/TensorLib): A spatial accelerator generation framework for tensor algebra. Did math work and programmatic front-end.
    + [Sanger](https://github.com/pku-liang/Sanger): A hardware-software co-design architecture on sparse attention. Did architecture design and hardware programming.
    + [Cement](https://github.com/pku-liang/Cement): A hardware description embedded language with various novel features. Did embedded language work in the front-end and FSM generation in the back-end. 
  + Works of my own interests are mostly under my repositories.
    + [TTGraph](https://github.com/semiwaker/TTGraph): A graph container in Rust, with typed nodes and transactional operations.
    + [ASVG](https://github.com/semiwaker/ASVG): basically a SVG binder in python, just for paper illustrations.
    + [Handle](https://github.com/arch-of-shadow/Handle): A pluggin for Chisel for FSM generation. Previous version of Cement.
